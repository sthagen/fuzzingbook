       "Sometimes we are not only interested in fuzzing as many as possible diverse program inputs, but in deriving specific test inputs that achieve some objective, such as reaching specific statements in a program. When we have an idea of what we are looking for, then we can search for it. Search algorithms are at the core of computer science, but applying classic search algorithms like breadth or depth first search to search for tests is unrealistic, because these algorithms potentially require us to look at all possible inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used to overcome this problem. For example, if we can estimate which of several program inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide us to reach the target quicker – this information is known as a heuristic. The way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in meta-heuristic search algorithms. The &quot;meta&quot; denotes that these algorithms are generic and can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In general they are much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that they can be applied to vast search spaces – search spaces as vast as the domain of program inputs are no problem for them.\">\n",

       "One of the problems with traditional methods of fuzzing is that they fail to exercise all the possible behaviors that a system can have, especially when the input space is large. Quite often the execution of a specific branch of execution may happen only with very specific inputs, which could represent an extremely small fraction of the input space. The traditional fuzzing methods relies on chance to produce inputs they need. However, relying on randomness to generate values that we want is a bad idea when the space to be explored is huge. For example, a function that accepts a string, even if one only considers the first $10$ characters, already has $2^{80}$ possible inputs. If one is looking for a specific string, random generation of values will take a few thousand years even in one of the super computers.\">\n",

    "* <a href=\"Coverage.ipynb\" title=\"Code Coverage (Coverage)&#10;&#10;In the previous chapter, we introduced basic fuzzing – that is, generating random inputs to test programs.  How do we measure the effectiveness of these tests?  One way would be to check the number (and seriousness) of bugs found; but if bugs are scarce, we need a proxy for the likelihood of a test to uncover a bug.  In this chapter, we introduce the concept of code coverage, measuring which parts of a program are actually executed during a test run.  Measuring such coverage is also crucial for test generators that attempt to cover as much code as possible.\">Code Coverage</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"MutationFuzzer.ipynb\" title=\"Mutation-Based Fuzzing (MutationFuzzer)&#10;&#10;Most randomly generated inputs are syntactically invalid and thus are quickly rejected by the processing program.  To exercise functionality beyond input processing, we must increase chances to obtain valid inputs.  One such way is so-called mutational fuzzing – that is, introducing small changes to existing inputs that may still keep the input valid, yet exercise new behavior.  We show how to create such mutations, and how to guide them towards yet uncovered code, applying central concepts from the popular AFL fuzzer.\">Mutation-Based Fuzzing</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb\" title=\"Greybox Fuzzing (GreyboxFuzzer)&#10;&#10;In the previous chapter, we have introduced mutation-based fuzzing, a technique that generates fuzz inputs by applying small mutations to given inputs. In this chapter, we show how to guide these mutations towards specific goals such as coverage. The algorithms in this chapter stem from the popular American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer, in particular from its AFLFast and AFLGo flavors. We will explore the greybox fuzzing algorithm behind AFL and how we can exploit it to solve various problems for automated vulnerability detection.\">Greybox Fuzzing</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"SearchBasedFuzzer.ipynb\" title=\"Search-Based Fuzzing (SearchBasedFuzzer)&#10;&#10;Sometimes we are not only interested in fuzzing as many as possible diverse program inputs, but in deriving specific test inputs that achieve some objective, such as reaching specific statements in a program. When we have an idea of what we are looking for, then we can search for it. Search algorithms are at the core of computer science, but applying classic search algorithms like breadth or depth first search to search for tests is unrealistic, because these algorithms potentially require us to look at all possible inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used to overcome this problem. For example, if we can estimate which of several program inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide us to reach the target quicker – this information is known as a heuristic. The way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in meta-heuristic search algorithms. The &quot;meta&quot; denotes that these algorithms are generic and can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In general they are much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that they can be applied to vast search spaces – search spaces as vast as the domain of program inputs are no problem for them.\">Search-Based Fuzzing</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"MutationAnalysis.ipynb\" title=\"Mutation Analysis (MutationAnalysis)&#10;&#10;In the chapter on coverage, we showed how one can identify which parts of the program are executed by a program, and hence get a sense of the effectiveness of a set of test cases in covering the program structure.  However, coverage alone may not be the best measure for the effectiveness of a test, as one can have great coverage without ever checking a result for correctness.  In this chapter, we introduce another means for assessing the effectiveness of a test suite: After injecting mutations – artificial faults – into the code, we check whether a test suite can detect these artificial faults.  The idea is that if it fails to detect such mutations, it will also miss real bugs.\">Mutation Analysis</a>\n",

In this chapter, we take this idea one step further, by providing a specification of the legal inputs to a program.  Specifying inputs via a grammar allows for very systematic and efficient test generation, in particular for complex input formats.  Grammars also serve as the base for configuration fuzzing, API fuzzing, GUI fuzzing, and many more.\">Fuzzing with Grammars</a>\n",

That is, given a string, one can decompose the string into its&#10;constituent parts that correspond to the parts of grammar used to generate it&#10;– the derivation tree of that string.

While the grammars we have seen so far have been rather simple, creating a grammar for complex inputs can involve quite some effort.  In this chapter, we therefore introduce techniques that automatically mine grammars from programs – by executing the programs and observing how they process which parts of the input.  In conjunction with a grammar fuzzer, this allows us to &#10;1. take a program, &#10;2. extract its input grammar, and &#10;3. fuzz it with high efficiency and effectiveness, using the concepts in this book.\">Mining Input Grammars</a>\n",

    "* <a href=\"SymbolicFuzzer.ipynb\" title=\"Symbolic Fuzzing (SymbolicFuzzer)&#10;&#10;One of the problems with traditional methods of fuzzing is that they fail to exercise all the possible behaviors that a system can have, especially when the input space is large. Quite often the execution of a specific branch of execution may happen only with very specific inputs, which could represent an extremely small fraction of the input space. The traditional fuzzing methods relies on chance to produce inputs they need. However, relying on randomness to generate values that we want is a bad idea when the space to be explored is huge. For example, a function that accepts a string, even if one only considers the first $10$ characters, already has $2^{80}$ possible inputs. If one is looking for a specific string, random generation of values will take a few thousand years even in one of the super computers.\">Symbolic Fuzzing</a>\n",

The configuration of a program – that is, the settings that govern the execution of a program on its (regular) input data, as set by options or configuration files – just as well influences behavior, and thus can and should be tested.  In this chapter, we explore how to systematically test and cover software configurations.  By automatically inferring configuration options, we can apply these techniques out of the box, with no need for writing a grammar.  Finally, we show how to systematically cover combinations of configuration options, quickly detecting unwanted interferences.\">Testing Configurations</a>\n",

This chapter introduces a technique known as carving, which, given a system test, automatically extracts a set of unit tests that replicate the calls seen during the system test.  The key idea is to record such calls such that we can replay them later – as a whole or selectively.
