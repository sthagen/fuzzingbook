       "Sometimes we are not only interested in fuzzing as many as possible diverse program inputs, but in deriving specific test inputs that achieve some objective, such as reaching specific statements in a program. When we have an idea of what we are looking for, then we can search for it. Search algorithms are at the core of computer science, but applying classic search algorithms like breadth or depth first search to search for tests is unrealistic, because these algorithms potentially require us to look at all possible inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used to overcome this problem. For example, if we can estimate which of several program inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide us to reach the target quicker – this information is known as a heuristic. The way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in meta-heuristic search algorithms. The &quot;meta&quot; denotes that these algorithms are generic and can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In general, they are much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that they can be applied to vast search spaces – search spaces as vast as the domain of program inputs are no problem for them.\">\n",

       "One of the problems with traditional methods of fuzzing is that they fail to exercise all the possible behaviors that a system can have, especially when the input space is large. Quite often the execution of a specific branch of execution may happen only with very specific inputs, which could represent a minimal fraction of the input space. The traditional fuzzing methods relies on chance to produce inputs they need. However, relying on randomness to generate values that we want is a bad idea when the space to be explored is huge. For example, a function that accepts a string, even if one only considers the first $10$ characters, already has $2^{80}$ possible inputs. If one is looking for a specific string, random generation of values will take a few thousand years even in one of the super computers.\">\n",

The conjunction with test generation offers several opportunities here, in particular for dynamic specification mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __[Mining input grammars](GrammarMiner.ipynb)__ promises to join the robustness and ease of use of lexical fuzzing with the efficiency and speed of syntactical fuzzing.  The idea is to mine an input grammar from a program automatically, which then serves as base for syntactical fuzzing.  Still in an early stage, but lots of potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __[Probabilistic grammar fuzzing](ProbabilisticGrammarFuzzer.ipynb)__ gives programmers lots of control over which elements should be generated.  Plenty of research possibilities at the intersection of probabilistic fuzzing and mining data from given tests, as sketched in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __[Fuzzing with generators](GeneratorGrammarFuzzer.ipynb)__ and __[Fuzzing with constraints](FuzzingWithConstraints.ipynb)__ gives programmers the ultimate control over input generation, namely by allowing them to define their own generator functions or to define their own input constraints.  The big challenge is: How can one best exploit the power of syntactic descriptions with a minimum of contextual constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __[Carving unit tests](Carver.ipynb)__ brings the promise of speeding up test execution (and generation) dramatically, by extracting unit tests from program executions that replay only individual function calls (possibly with new, generated arguments).  In Python, carving is simple to realize; here's plenty of potential to toy with.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Testing [web servers](WebFuzzer.ipynb) and [GUIs](GUIFuzzer.ipynb)__ is a hot research field, fueled by the need of practitioners to test and secure their interfaces (and the need of other practitioners to break through these interfaces).  Again, there's still lots of unexplored potential here.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __[Greybox fuzzing](GreyboxFuzzer.ipynb) and [greybox fuzzing with grammars](GreyboxGrammarFuzzer.ipynb)__ bring in _statistical estimators_ to guide test generation towards inputs and input properties that are most likely to discover new bugs.  The intersection of testing, program analysis, and statistics offers lots of possibilities for future research."
